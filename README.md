## 🖥 Example Output

```bash

Project Health Score: 72/100

Architecture:

✔ Clear module separation

⚠ High coupling between services

✖ Missing abstraction layer in /core

Tech Debt:

- 14 large files (>500 LOC)

- 6 TODO blocks older than 90 days

- 3 unused dependencies

Risk Areas:

- Payment service tightly coupled to DB layer

- No abstraction for external APIs

- Missing integration tests for critical flows
```
Suggestions:

1. Extract interface layer for service modules

2. Reduce file size in /controllers

3. Add integration tests for payment flow

4. Introduce dependency inversion in /core
